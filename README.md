# Logistic Regression for Lead Scoring 

This repository provides a Python implementation of logistic regression for lead scoring tasks.

## Purpose:

* Predicts the likelihood of a lead converting into a customer.
* Assigns a score to each lead, indicating its potential value.
* Provides a foundation for understanding binary classification in sales and marketing applications.

## Implementation:

* Uses Python's `scikit-learn` library to implement logistic regression.
* Allows for feature scaling and normalization.
* Provides functionality for model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
* Implements methods for visualizing model performance and feature importance.

## Usage:

1.  Install necessary Python packages (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2.  Input your lead dataset (features and conversion target variable).
3.  Run the provided Python script (`lead_scoring_logistic_regression.py`).
4.  Specify any desired feature scaling or regularization parameters.
5.  Interpret output:
    * The script outputs the model's performance metrics (accuracy, AUC-ROC, etc.).
    * Feature importance is visualized to understand which features drive conversion.
    * Lead scores are generated and can be used for prioritization.

## Key Concepts:

* **Logistic Regression:** A binary classification algorithm used to predict probabilities.
* **Lead Scoring:** Assigning a numerical score to a lead based on its likelihood to convert.
* **Feature Importance:** Determining the impact of each feature on the model's prediction.
* **AUC-ROC:** Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, a metric for evaluating classification models.
* **Binary Classification:** Assigning data points to one of two predefined categories (converted/not converted).

## Output:

* Model performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).
* Feature importance visualizations.
* Lead scores for each lead.
* Information about the parameters used (scaling, regularization).
